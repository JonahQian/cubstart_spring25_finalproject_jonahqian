# CS 198 Final 

# Project Name: HoopHub
Team Members: Jonah Qian


# Application Description: 
HoopHub is a web application tailored to the needs of our basketball club. The app allows players and coaches to stay updated with upcoming games and practices, log and view player stats, and engage with shared team media like game highlights or practice photos. The application solves the common issue of fragmented communication and stat tracking across group chats, spreadsheets, and emails by consolidating everything into one sleek platform.

  Tech: JavaScript, Firebase (for data), HTML/CSS
- Media Gallery: Share game highlights or photos using embedded YouTube/Vimeo links.
  Tech: JavaScript, YouTube API or Firebase Storage
- Team Feed: Bulletin board for team updates and announcements.
